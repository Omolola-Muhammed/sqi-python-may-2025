# üõí 1. Grocery Store ‚Äì Find Common Items in Carts
# Exercise:
# You have two shopping carts. Each contains a list of items. Use sets to find:

# Items both people are buying # eggs, butter

# Items only one of them is buying   # milk, bread, cheese, yoghurt

# All items either of them is buying # milk, bread, eggs, butter, cheese, yoghurt

# cart1 = ["milk", "bread", "eggs", "butter"]
# cart2 = ["eggs", "butter", "cheese", "yogurt"]

# same_item = set(cart1).intersection(set(cart2))
# print(same_item)

# one_of_them = set(cart1.)

# üéü 2. Movie Club ‚Äì Count Unique Movies Watched
# Exercise:
# Three friends watched movies over the weekend. Each of them lists the movies they saw. Use sets to find out:

# How many unique movies were watched in total.

# alice = {"Inception", "Titanic", "Joker"}
# bob = {"Joker", "Interstellar", "Inception"}
# carol = {"Avatar", "Titanic", "Joker"}

# unique = alice.union(bob).union(carol)
# print(unique)

# Answer: "Inception", "Titanic", "Joker", "Interstellar", "Avatar"

# üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë 3. Party Invite List ‚Äì Avoid Duplicates
# Exercise:
# You‚Äôre creating a guest list. Some names were added twice by mistake. Use a set to fix this.

# guest_list = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Alice", "Bob", "Diana"]
# print(set(guest_list))

# üè´ 4. Students in Clubs ‚Äì Who‚Äôs in Both?
# Exercise:
# In a school, some students are in the science club, and some are in the music club. Find students who are in both.

# science_club = {"John", "Mia", "Liam", "Olivia"}
# music_club = {"Emma", "Liam", "Noah", "Olivia"}

# science_music = science_club.intersection(music_club)
